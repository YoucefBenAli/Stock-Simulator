# Stock-Simulator
This is a simulation of real life stock investing. The game first asks for you to first create an account with a username and password and then log in. You start with a balance of $50,000 which you could use to invest in stocks. The stocks values are real and taken from a module called yahoo_fin. To run the simulation you need to install the following modules: pandas, pandas_datareader, yahoo_fin, matplotlib.  

The game is currently bugged and won't work.
